# Box WordPress Editor Tools

A collection of tools for modifying the WordPress Editor. 

## Quick Start!

All the tools load automatically if you've installed this as a plugin to your WordPress site. If not, you can use each class as needed.

There's more options for each tool, so checkout the links below: 

## Features

 - [Asset Loader](./docs/AssetLoader.md) - help load assets generated by [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/).
 - [Block Loader](./docs/BlockLoader.md) - auto-loads blocks to the editor.
 - [Comment Disablement](./docs/Comments.md) - disables comments.
 - [Editor Cleanup](./docs/EditorCleanup.md) - removes some unnecessary bits from the block editor.
 - [Post Type Registrations](./docs/PostTypes.md) - speeds up post-type registration with a single JSON file. 
 - [Template Persistence](./docs/TemplatePersistence.md) - speeds up template modifications by saving to disk instead of the database. 
 - [Security](./docs/Security.md) - Adds security hardening.
